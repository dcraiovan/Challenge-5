## Overview of the analysis

The following analysis is a summary of the ride-sharing data by city type. Using Pandas and Matplotlib I created multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type which shows how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.
